                The Wii is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo. 
                It was released on November 19, 2006, in North America and in December 2006 
                for most other regions of the world. It is Nintendo's fifth major home game console, 
                following the GameCube and is a seventh-generation console alongside Microsoft's Xbox 360 
                and Sony's PlayStation 3.

                Nintendo began conceptualizing their next console. 
                The company's game designer Shigeru Miyamoto said that, 
                in the early stages, they decided they would not aim to 
                compete on hardware power, and would instead prioritize 
                new gameplay concepts. Miyamoto cited Dance Dance 
                Revolution's unique game controllers as inspiration for 
                developing new input devices. Later in September 24, 2001, 
                Nintendo began working with Gyration Inc., 
                a firm that had developed several patents related to motion 
                detection, to prototype future controllers using their licensed 
                patents.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2003, Iwata met with Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda to discuss their market research. 
                Iwata instructed Takeda "to go off the tech roadmap" for this 
                console, but said it had to be appealing to mothers. 
                Iwata wanted their next console to be capable of playing past 
                Nintendo games, eliminating clutter in houses. Takeda led 
                the team building the console's hardware components, and 
                Miyamoto spearheaded the development of a new type of 
                controller, based on Gyration's motion-sensing technology. 
                Iwata had proposed that this new console use motion sensing to 
                simplify the gaming interface, increasing appeal to all audiences. 
                An initial prototype was completed within six months.
            </p>



            <h3>Announcements (2004-2005)</h3>
            <div class="sectionIMG">
                <img src="/Markup-Styles/Styles/WiiImg/Wii_Display.jpg" />
            </div>
            <p>
                Iwata had referred to Nintendo's upcoming console offering as the 
                GameCube Next (GCNext or GCN). Iwata first 
                unveiled some details of Nintendo's new home console
                at E3 2004 under the codename "Revolution", as 
                Iwata believed the console would revolutionize the 
                gaming industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Iwata later unveiled and demonstrated their current prototype of the Revolution controller at the 
                Tokyo Game Show in September 2005. At this stage, 
                the controller unit resembled the final Wii Remote 
                device along with the separate Nunchuk attachment. 
                Iwata demonstrated its motion sensing gameplay 
                capabilities, and incorporated commentary from 
                developers, such as Hideo Kojima and Yuji Horii, 
                who had tested the controller and believed people 
                would be drawn in by it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The console's name was formally 
                announced as the Wii in April 2006, 
                a month prior to E3 2006. Nintendo's 
                spelling of "Wii" (with two lower-case "i" 
                characters) was intended to represent both 
                two people standing side by side, and the 
                Wii Remote and its Nunchuk. In the 
                company's announcement, they stated: 
                "Wii sounds like 'we', which emphasizes 
                that the console is for everyone. Wii can 
                easily be remembered by people around the 
                world, no matter what language they speak. 
                No confusion."
            </p>
            <p>
                The Wii was made available for a press 
                demonstration at E3 2006. Planned launch 
                titles were announced at a press conference 
                alongside the unveiling. At the same 
                conference, Nintendo confirmed its plans 
                to release the console by the end of 2006.
            </p>


            <h3>Launch (2006-2010)</h3>
            <div class="sectionIMG">
                <img src="/Markup-Styles/Styles/WiiImg/Wii_launch.jpg" />
            </div>
            <p>
                Nintendo announced the launch plans and 
                prices for the Wii in September 2006. 
                The console was first launched in the 
                United States on November 19, 2006, for 
                US$249.99. Other regional release dates 
                and prices included Japan on December 2 for 
                ¥25,000, followed by Australasia on 
                December 7 for A$399.95, and was later 
                launched on December 8 in the United Kingdom 
                for £179.99 and for the majority of Europe 
                for €249.99. Nintendo planned to have 
                around 30 Wii games available by the end of 
                2006, and anticipated shipping over 4 million 
                consoles before the end of the year.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of its launch campaign, 
                Nintendo promoted the Wii in North America 
                through a series of television 
                advertisements (directed by Academy Award 
                winner Stephen Gaghan); its Internet ads 
                used the slogans "Wii would like to play" 
                and "Experience a new way to play". The ads 
                began in November 2006 and had a budget of 
                over $200 million for the year. The ads 
                targeted a wider demographic compared to ads 
                for other consoles, inviting parents and 
                grandparents to play on the Wii. Nintendo 
                hoped that its console would appeal to a 
                wider demographic than that of others in the 
                seventh generation. In December 2006, 
                Satoru Iwata said that Nintendo did not think 
                of themselves as "fighting Sony", but were 
                focused on how they could expand the gaming 
                demographic.

                Unlike the company's previous consoles, 
                they built the Wii from commercial 
                off-the-shelf hardware rather than seek out 
                customized components. This helped to reduce 
                the cost of the Wii system to consumers. 
                Miyamoto said "Originally, I wanted a machine 
                that would cost $100. My idea was to spend 
                nothing on the console technology so all the 
                money could be spent on improving the 
                interface and software.
            </p>
            <p>
                The console's central processing unit is a 
                32-bit IBM PowerPC-based processor named 
                Broadway, with a clock frequency of 729 MHz. 
                The reduced size of Broadway—based on a 90 nm 
                process compared to the 180 nm process used in the 
                GameCube's CPU—resulted in 20% lowered power 
                consumption. The Wii's GPU is a system on a 
                chip produced by ATI and named Hollywood; the core 
                processor runs at 243 MHz, 3 MB of texture memory, 
                digital signal processors, and input/output 
                functions. Additionally, the GPU included an 
                additional 24 MB of 1T-SRAM and an additional 64 MB 
                of 1T-SRAM on the motherboard, totaling to 88 MB of 
                memory for the console. The Wii's computational 
                power was roughly 1.5 to 2 times as powerful as the 
                GameCube, but was the least powerful of the 
                major home consoles of its generation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Wii was Nintendo's smallest home console 
                at the time (the current smallest is hybrid 
                home-portable console Nintendo Switch, when in 
                portable mode); it measures 44 mm (1.73 in) wide, 
                157 mm (6.18 in) tall and 215.4 mm (8.48 in) deep 
                in its vertical orientation, slightly larger than 
                three DVD cases stacked together. The included 
                stand measures 55.4 mm (2.18 in) wide, 44 mm 
                (1.73 in) tall and 225.6 mm (8.88 in) deep. 
                The system weighs 1.2 kg (2.7 lb), making 
                it the lightest of the three major 
                seventh-generation consoles. The Wii may stand 
                horizontally or vertically.

            <h3>Wii Remote</h3>
            <div class="sectionIMG">
                <img src="/Markup-Styles/Styles/WiiImg/Wiimote.jpg" />
            </div>
            <p>
                The Wii Remote is the primary controller for the 
                console. The remote contains a MEMS-based 
                three-dimension accelerometer, along with 
                infrared detection sensors located at the far 
                end of the controller. The accelerometers 
                allow the Wii Remote to recognize its orientation 
                after being moved from a resting position, 
                translating that motion into gesture recognition 
                for a game. For example, the pack-in game Wii 
                Sports includes a ten-pin bowling game that had the 
                player hold the Wii Remote and perform a delivery 
                of a ball; the Wii Remote could account for the 
                player's position relative to the Sensor Bar, and 
                their arm and wrist rotation to apply speed and 
                spin to the virtual ball's delivery on screen. 
                The infrared detectors are used to track emissions 
                from LEDs in the included Sensor Bar, which is 
                placed just above or below the television display, 
                as to track the relative orientation of the Wii 
                Remote towards the screen. This gives the Wii 
                Remote the ability to act as a pointing device 
                like a computer mouse on the television screen, 
                with an approximate 15 feet (4.6 m) range for 
                accurate detection. In addition, the Wii 
                Remote features traditional controller inputs, 
                including a directional pad (d-pad), three face 
                action buttons and a shoulder trigger, and four 
                system-related buttons include a power switch. 
                The Wii Remote connects to the Wii through 
                Bluetooth with an approximate 30 feet (9.1 m) 
                range, communicating the sensor and control 
                information to the console unit. The Wii Remote 
                includes an internal speaker and a rumble pack 
                that can be triggered by a game to provide 
                feedback directly to the player's hand. Up to 
                four Wii Remotes could connect wirelessly to a Wii, 
                with LED lights on each remote indicating which 
                controller number the Remote had connected as. 
                The remote is battery-operated, and when the Remote 
                is not powered on, these LED lights can display 
                the remaining battery power.
            </p>

            <p>
                A wrist-mounted strap is included with the Wii Remote, 
                with one end affixed to the bottom of the unit. 
                Nintendo strongly encouraged players to use the 
                strap in case the Wii Remote accidentally slipped 
                out of their hands. Nintendo recalled the original 
                straps in December 2006 and provided a free, 
                stronger strap as a replacement, as well as 
                packaging the new strap in future bundles after 
                the company faced legal challenges from users that 
                reported damage to their homes from the Wii Remote 
                slipping from their hands while playing. 
                In October 2007, Nintendo also added a silicon-based
                Wii Remote Jacket to shipments of the Wii and Wii 
                Remote, as well as a free offering for existing 
                users. The Jacket wraps around the bulk of the 
                remote but leaves access to the various buttons 
                and connectors, providing a stickier surface in 
                the user's grip to further reduce the chance of 
                the Remote falling out of the player's hand.
